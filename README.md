## Craigslist Gig Finder


Basically I wanted a way to find photography gigs so I used Craigslist, and then I automated it. This generates two .csv files, one with possible duplicates (in the titles) and one without (just in case something is filtered out completely). The .csv includes the Craigslist post title, url, and post date.
